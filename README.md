# Flame-ID 
A blockchain Dapp for real-time wildfire data and alerts.

## Inspiration âœ¨
Flame-ID aims to contribute to the UN goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, by making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It is an experimental hackathon project designed to demonstrate blockchain utility, while highlighting a UN sustainability goal - especially aiming to enable safe, and resilient human settlements. When we take action to solve our problems, we are taking the responsibility to ensure a brighter future for all. 

## What it does ðŸ’¡ 
Flame ID is a Dapp that provides users with real-time data and alerts on wildfire risk and activity. 
Potential data from tweets and public local fire websites aggregated with Hedera consensus service(HCS), with smart contracts deployed on Flow blockchain.

## How we built it ðŸª„
- Frontend with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** - display data and alerts.
- A Python script gathers Fire data from the web before it is cleaned up for request by the app dashboard.
- **Web3.js** or **flow.js** to interact with blockchain or smart contract using Javascript.
- Using the Hedera Mirror Node API and the Flow Access API, the app is executed via JavaScript, the Hedera SDK, and the Flow JS SDK to query blockchain backend.
